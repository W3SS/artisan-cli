# Artisan CLI

A global command line tool ( inspired by the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)) for Laravel's [Artisan](http://laravel.com/docs/artisan). 

## Use this if...

* You don't want to type `php` before every `artisan` command
* You want to call `artisan` commands from within your [Laravel](http://laravel.com) project's subdirectories

## Installation

The recommended way to install [Artisan CLI](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/artisan-cli) is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```shell
composer global require johnnyfreeman/artisan-cli:*
```
