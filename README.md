### Artisan CLI

A global command line tool for [Artisan](http://laravel.com/docs/artisan) inspired by the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli). 

##### Use this if...

* You don't want to type `php` before every `artisan` command
* You want to call `artisan` commands from within [Laravel](http://laravel.com) subdirectories

##### Installation

To install, download the `artisan` script and add it to your `PATH`.
