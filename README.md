A global command line tool for [Artisan](http://laravel.com/docs/artisan) inspired by the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli). It's purpose is to eliminate the need to type `php` before every `artisan` command.

To install, you'll want to download the `artisan` script into your PATH somewhere. Once you've done this, go to your [Laravel](http://laravel.com) project, and start using `artisan` commands withOUT php in front of it. WOOT!
